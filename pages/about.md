I have joined the IRLab of the University in Amsterdam in January 2022 as a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Maarten de Rijke, in partnership with Naver Labs Europe where Jean-Michel Renders is advising me.

Previously I have been working as a research engineer at Naver Labs Europe in Grenoble and at Huawei in Stockholm.
